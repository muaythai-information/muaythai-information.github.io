      <p>In Muay Thai, there are countless of techniques, combinations and variations to them, with each fighter putting their own fighting style into them. From the way you stand to the way you react to counterattack a spinning backfist, every movement can make the difference in a fight. Below are a few of the basic Muay Thai techniques and tips. It is explained from the perspective of right handed people, and left handed people just do the opposite.

      <h3>STANCE AND FOOTWORK</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The stance changes slightly from person to person, depending on their build and what suits them best, but a good stance is determined by stability and the speed or ease in which one can attack or defend with any technique. Here are a few basic <b>tips for a good Muay Thai stance</b> :
        <ol>
          <li>Stand with feet shoulder width apart and the dominant foot slightly to the back. This allows for a stable base, and to pack more momentum and power into attacks from the dominant side.</li>
          <li>Stand reasonably square to your opponent to make it easier for quick attacks with the legs. This is unlike a regular boxing stance, in which the body is turned nearly 90° away from the opponent.</li>
          <li>Stand on the balls of your feet to create a ‘light footed’ feeling, which helps with speedy footwork and strikes.</li>
          <li>Keep your chin tucked in towards your chest whilst still looking upwards towards your opponent and your hands up near your face, with your dominant hand close to your cheek or temple and your other hand in front of your face. In addition, keep your elbows tucked in towards your body. This protects the face, promotes swift blocks and has a lower chance of injury.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In the ring, you never want your back to be facing your opponent. Your opponent will move around often to get opportunities to attack any vulnerable areas, and so must you. This is where footwork comes into play. Here are a few <b>tips for footwork</b> :
        <ol>
          <li>Always go back to your original stance. After any attack or block, go back to your regular stance to give you the best position to go into the next few moves and to maintain the fluidity between movements.</li>
          <li>Never cross your feet over each other. Always ensure your feet are inline with their respective shoulder and that your dominant foot is at the back during the normal stance. This is to prevent you from going off-balance. To do this, when moving in any direction, move the foot closest to that direction first. For example, when moving right, move the right foot right first, then the left foot.</li>
          <li>Always take small, controlled steps. Remain light footed at all time. This keeps you ready to defend in a moment’s notice, as going from a wide stance into a block can throw you off balance.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

        <p><b>Punch <i>(chok; ชก)</i></b></p>
        <p>
          Modern Muay Thai punching techniques have been influenced greatly by Western boxing. Many are very similar, with the exception of modifying them to fit the Muay Thai stance. When punching, it is important to use your whole body by rotating your torso, hips and feet slightly to give your punch momentum, speed and power. Punches are usually done with horizontally aligned knuckles, and to ensure your thumb won’t break upon impact, keep it wrapped on the bottom of the outside of your fist. Relax your body, but tighten your fist when striking. To keep a safe distance from your opponent and to prevent counter strikes, go in and out for the punch quickly, return back to your original position after executing a punch or combination, extend your arm to give you more reach by twisting your upper body and stay light on your feet.

              <div class="panel-body">The jab is the most basic of punches. It involves a small step forward with your left foot whilst straightening your left arm to strike. Though it uses your less dominant arm, a good jab should still be powerful and quick so that it can disrupt an opponent’s attacks or set up for your own combination of attacks.</div>

              <div class="panel-body">The cross is the opposite of the jab and is done with the dominant arm, causing it to be known as the power shot. Instead of aiming straight ahead, it is angled slightly to the left and requires you to twist your shoulder forwards and right ankle outwards for better reach and momentum. Because it starts from further back and requires more hip torque, it enables you to generate more power.</div>

                The hook is feared for its knockout power and unpredictability due to its sideways angle. It is orthodoxically done with the left, less dominant hand, as it feels more natural and is already positioned closer to your opponent, so it is quicker. To get maximum power and ease of movement, twist the ankle of your lead ankle outwards whilst pivoting your upper body clockwise. Ensure your left arm is bent and parallel to the ground. Good hooks are clean, fast and controlled.

                The uppercut is a punch that comes from an unexpected angle, with its power coming from the legs. As its name suggests, it goes from down to up and lands on the underside of the opponent’s jaw. Its momentum is generated through slightly bending your legs and drawing a small circle with your shoulder before striking.

                Overhands are similar to the cross, but can be more devastating because of the extra power from the high to low angle, as if following a small semi-circle. The elbow is also tilted slightly higher than a normal cross.

        <p>Certain punches, like the jab, cross and hook, can be also aimed towards the opponent’s body. These punches are usually to tire out your opponent gradually during a fight, but a well placed body punch in certain spots, like the liver, can win a round.</p>

        <p><b>Elbow <i>(sok; ศอก)</i></b></p>
        <p>
          The elbow is considered the most lethal form of attack  in Muay Thai, as the elbow joint is extremely hard and sharp. When landed correctly, it can ‘cut’ or split the skin on an opponent’s forehead completely, and draw blood. When doing an elbow, make sure to strike and draw back quickly, with the non-attacking hand up to protect your face.

              <div class="panel-body">The elbow slash is the most common and basic elbow technique. It involves flinging the elbow diagonally downwards at a 45° angle to ‘slash’ the opponent’s head, like a knife would, to cut above the eye. To perform this technique from the normal Muay Thai stance, you must direct your elbow upwards while tucking in your hand towards your chest. Then, from the highest point of the elbow arc, you must ‘slash’ your elbow downwards across an opponent’s face by twisting your shoulder inwards. While doing this, you must rotate your hips inwards to give the attack maximum strength. This can be done with either elbow.</div>

                This technique is used to get through high guards, as the angle it goes through allows it to cut upwards between the gloves. It can be done with both elbows, and must be done with a small step forwards to get momentum. You would aim for the bottom of your opponent’s face and swing your elbow upwards so that your palm is behind your head and your forearm covers the side of your head.

                This technique is usually done with the dominant arm to generate most power. It involves shoving the tip of one’s elbow directly forwards into the center of an opponent’s face. Raise your elbow so that the tip is aimed directly forwards. While stepping forwards slightly with your front leg, you would ‘stab’ your elbow forwards. It differs from the uppercut elbow in the sense that an uppercut elbow is a movement that goes from down to up, whereas a foward elbow thrust is directly forwards.

                This is not a very common technique, as it is from an odd angle and can be easily predicted by opponents if it is from a long distance away. When doing this with the rear (dominant) elbow, your left foot would step inwards and across to your right, so that your back is almost facing the opponent. Then, you would rotate your hips clockwise while bringing your elbow up to strike the opponent’s head. Due to the degree of movement involved, a lot of momentum can be generated with this.

        <p><b>The follow up elbow :</b></p>
        <p>Elbow techniques can be used as individual attacks or <b>follow up elbows</b>. A follow-up elbow are elbows used in combinations with other attacks from the same arm, like a left hook followed by a left elbow. These are utilised when the attacker wants to deliver blows when there is too small a distance between the opponent to punch or kick.</p>

        <p><b>Kick <i>(te; เตะ)</i></b></p>
        <p>
          The brutality of Muay Thai kicks is what makes it famously different from boxing. Like punches, kicks can be done at different heights : to the opponent’s head, body or legs. Head kicks are the hardest to successfully pull off, as the head is protected most by your opponent’s hands, and it is the easiest to predict and defend against. However, if it lands correctly, it can do a lot of damage and can knock out an opponent. Body kicks are the most common types, as it is easiest to generate the most power. Leg kicks are often used at the end of a combination, and a few solid kicks to the leg can easily bring an opponent down.

              <div class="panel-body">This is the most basic of all kicks, and the most famous. The theory behind this kick comes from the swinging motion of the legs when the hips are twisted. Step outwards with your left foot and swing your right leg in a wide arc to hit your opponent. Use your hips to generate force by turning inwards and slightly downwards. Ensure that your weight is balanced on the standing leg, you are on the balls of your feet and your standing foot turns inwards. Instead of stopping your force when you hit your opponent, imagine you are swinging all the way through. Swing your right hand down when kicking with the right leg and keep the left hand up the protect your face. To kick with the left foot, do a ‘switch’, in which you jump slightly to bring your back foot forward and front foot back, and repeat all above steps on the opposite side.

        <p><b>Foot Thrust <i>(teep; ถีบ)</i></b></p>
        <p>
          Foot thrusts are considered a type of kick, but instead of hitting the opponent with your shin, the teep is a push-kick, where the ball of the foot is ‘jabbed’ into the target. It can be used offensively, like knocking the breath of an opponent, and defensively to create space between fighters. The teep can be done with both legs. The rear leg is usually used more offensively as it has more power, but is slower.

        <p><b>Knee <i>(khao; เข่า)</i></b></p>
        <p>
          Knees can be used for regular attacks and for close contact fighting while in a clinch. Just like the elbow, striking with the hard knee joint is very powerful and can often break bones. These knee techniques are explained through kneeing with your dominant back leg. To knee with the front leg, you can either do a ‘switch’ and follow the same steps, or directly knee forward with your front leg. However, kneeing with the back leg will always generate more power as there is more momentum involved.

              <div class="panel-body">The power from this knee comes from leaning back and thrusting your hips forward to land your knee directly into the center of the opponent. Imagine you are doing a teep, except you are much closer and you bend your attacking leg so your knee is leading. Contrary to its name, the straight knee is not thrown straight forward; instead it is slightly diagonal to hit the center of the opponent’s stomach and to open up the hips for a further range. The hand on the same side of the knee goes down, like in a normal kick, whereas the other stays up to protect your face.

                A jumping knee includes a hop/step towards the opponent to get more power and height into the knee. A flying knee takes this one step further by adding a jump to the step and switching your legs in midair, so that you land with your back foot in front.

        </div>
        <br>
          <br>
      <p>The clinch is a position in which two fighters come close enough to grapple, or hold each other around the neck / body. As there is so little space between fighters, elbows and knees are the most effective to strike. Neck strength is especially important, as fighters need to hold up their heads to prevent from getting kneed in the face. To do this, they often lift weights with their mouth or do pull-ups. From a clinch position, you can sweep or throw your opponent, or strike an opponent until they let go. The dominant clincher is the person with their arms on the inside, as it is easier for them to control their opponent. The clinch is often overlooked as unimportant or ‘boring’ to watch in Muay Thai, as fighters typically remain in a neutral position when they grapple for dominance.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Front Clinch
            <br>
            This is the normal clinching form in which both hands are locked onto the back of your opponent’s neck to put downwards pressure on their shoulders and neck. 
          </li>
          <li>Arm Clinch
            <br>
            This is where one hand is on the back of the opponent’s neck, like in a front clinch, and the other is holding the inside of their arm. This creates slightly more space for attacks and gives more control over the opponent.
          </li>
          <li>Side Clinch
            <br>
            One arm circles around the front of the opponent which the other is around their back, giving access to the opponent’s sides for attacks like knees.
          </li>
          <li>Low Clinch
            <br>
            Instead of holding on to your opponent at their neck height, this clinching technique is more used by shorter fighters in which their arms hold their opponent from under their armpits.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p><b>Throws and Takedowns from the Clinch</b></p>
      <p>
        This form of attack can only be done once a fighter has a very secure position in the clinch. The dominant clincher basically sweeps their opponent off their feet by throwing them sideways or straight downwards onto the ground. Good body control and balance to shift your weight to get enough power to throw your opponent is needed, as well as good timing to know the right moment to take down your opponent when they are unbalanced.

        <h3>DEFENSE</h3>
      <h4>TECHNIQUES</h4>
        
          <br>
      <p>Knowing how to react to an opponent’s attacks and to defend yourself is just as important as your attacking skills, otherwise a fight would end in a knockout and a few painful injuries rather quickly. There are six categories of defense in Muay Thai :</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Blocking
            <br>
            Blocks are when you position a body part in the way of an attack to prevent it from reaching its target and doing more damage. Typically, the arms are used to block arm strikes or head kicks and the shins are used to block body and low leg strikes. An example of a block is the ‘check’, shown below, where one raises their leg so that an attack lands on the shin. Another example below is for blocking hooks by raising the elbow upwards at the side of your face to protect your head.

          </li>
          <li>Redirection or Parrying
            <br>
            Parries are small movements done to change the direction of an attack so that it doesn’t hit its target. This technique is usually done for punches, as it is easier to redirect them. An example of this is a downwards tap by the right hand to redirect a jab thrown by an opponent’s left hand. The term redirection can also refer to redirecting the opponent’s attention from an attack, or ‘faking’ / ‘feinting’.

          <li>Avoidance
            <br>
            Though harder to perfect, this technique saves you from feeling any impact from an attack at all. Though blocks are useful, they wear you down after a while. Avoiding an attack, by leaning backwards or stepping back for example, still allows you to counter attack your opponent because you are still within your range, so it is extremely useful. 
          </li>
          <li>Anticipation
            <br>
            Anticipation involves predicting an opponent’s next move and striking before they start their attack. For example, a low kick aimed at an opponent’s front leg prevents them from attacking you with a kick of their own.
          </li>
          <li>Disruption
            <br>
            This form of defense uses you own attacks to stop an opponent’s attacks while they are carrying it out, unlike anticipation which is done before the strike. This throws them off rhythm as well and ‘disrupts’ their attacking momentum. Push kicks are often used because they are powerful and easily throw opponents off balance, especially if they’re doing kicks.
          </li>
          <li>Countering
            <br>
            These are movements done to turn their attacks into opportunities for you to attack them. Catching body kicks teeps is a common counter, as it can transition into various attacks like throws and knees, and it puts you in a position of power as you control one of your opponent’s ‘weapons’. Countering can be a form of disruption or anticipation.
