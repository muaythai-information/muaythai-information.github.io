                <b>Muay Thai Gloves</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Muay Thai gloves differ from normal boxing gloves because they permit you to open your hands for a good grip when clinching. Gloves protect your hands from injury and reduces major damage to opponents and sparring partners. They vary in weight, fit and colour/pattern, depending on the fighter’s preferences. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Hand Wraps</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Wraps are pieces of cloth that are wrapped around your palm, fingers and wrists to further protect you from injury. It also provides padding for the knuckles and is more hygienic than using just gloves, as they can be washed easily. The way you wrap your hands affects the amount and areas of protection it provides, depending on what you are doing, e.g working with the punching bags, sparring.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Muscle Liniment</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Muscle Liniment is a ‘hot’ oil used by Thai fighters to soothe muscle pains, warm up their muscles and lessen the likelihood of muscle injuries. It can be applied both before and after training. It causes a burning feeling when sweating, as it is a strong oil. A tub of this ointment is an essential in any fighter's gym bag. Common brands include Namman Muay and Tiger Balm.

      <h3>PROTECTIVE GEAR</h3>
      <br>
      <p><b>Shin Guards</b></p>
      <p>
        Shin guards protect your shins and the top of your feet with padding when kicking or blocking. Shin guards are typically secured to your legs with velcro, but there are sock shin guards that are much more tight fitting and are worn like socks, but don’t offer as much protection.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Mouth Guard</b></p>
      <p>
        Mouth guards are essential in sparring, clinching and fights to protect your teeth from getting knocked out. Boil-and-bite mouth guards are ones that you have to fit to your teeth yourself through, as the name suggests, boiling it briefly, biting down on it and submerging it in ice water. Custom guards can also be purchased for a better fit, but are much more expensive.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Ankle Guards</b></p>
      <p>
        For people with weak ankles, these guards give support and more balance in the ring. Ankle guards need to be tight fitting, but they may cut off blood circulation if they are too small.

                <b>Muay Thai Pads / Kick Pads</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Muay Thai pads are used by a trainer to mimic an opponent by positioning the pads in a certain manner. These pads can be used for punches, kicks, knees, elbows and push kicks, and are thick enough for students to strike with their full strength without injuring the trainer. They can vary in size to absorb a general range of strikes to larger pads for kicks in particular.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Boxing Pads / Focus Mitts</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Boxing pads are used for purely punches and elbows. They are much smaller than Muay Thai pads to train your precision in striking a target. These are also easier to use in training your defense, as they are small enough to be swung, mimicking a Muay Thai glove.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Stomach Pad</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                These protect the trainer from powerful push kicks during pad work without having to move their arms to position their hand pads. Trainers can also turn sideways to absorb body kicks and knees. This piece of equipment is not always used, but just makes it easier for trainers.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Heavy Bags</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Muay Thai heavy bags allow students to train without a trainer. Just like pads, they vary in size and shape for different types of techniques. Some are cylindrical whereas some, like the angled heavy bag, protrude at the top to absorb a wide range of attacks.
