      <h3>ORIGINS AND INFLUENCES</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Muay Thai is believed to have been developed by the many migrating Siamese tribes, like the <i>Sukhothai</i>, centuries ago as a way to defend themselves against the many other hostile tribes they encountered along their journey. In their time, it was kill or be killed. The techniques unique to Muay Thai were perfected over many generations through trial-and-error as it was passed down from father to son, until each movement in a fight had purpose and was effective against an opponent. In this way, Muay Thai became an integrated part of Thai / Siamese culture.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Even after Siam became Thailand, the country was constantly under attack from neighbouring countries. The Muay Thai techniques that were already part of their culture was militarised for warfare. It became mandatory for all Thai soldiers to undergo vigorous Muay Thai training to know how to attack and defend themselves without weapons.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        One of the most famous Muay Thai fighters is the ‘father of Muay Thai’ : <i>Nai Khanom Tom</i>. During the 1767 Burmese raid of Ayudhaya, the Thai capital at the time, many prisoners were taken as slaves. One of them was a skilled Muay Thai fighter called <i>Nai Khanom Tom</i>. During the Burmese’s victory celebrations, the king ordered some of the Thai prisoners to fight against Burma’s best fighters for entertainment. When it was <i>Nai Khanom Tom's</i> turn to fight, he performed the first Wai Khru Ram Muay dance to honor his teacher and country. Then, he proceeded to defeat more than a dozen of Burma’s best fighters, taking each one down with vicious ease. The Burmese King, amazed by his skill, granted him his freedom. He returned to Thailand as a hero, and to this day, Muay Thai day is celebrated on March 16th in Thailand in <i>Nai Khanom Tom's</i> honor.

      <p><b>WAI KHRU RAM MUAY (wâːj kʰrūː rām mūɛj; ไหว้ครูรำมวย)</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <i>Wai Khru Ram Muay</i> is a traditional ritual dance performed by a fighter before each fight to respect their teacher, opponent, country, family and religion. Each fighter’s <i>Wai Khru Ram Muay</i> is different, and can be personalised to show one’s techniques, teacher, and background. This dance is performed to music called <i>Wong Pee Glong</i>, played live by four musicians on traditional Thai instruments like the Javanese oboe, Thai drums and small cymbals.

      <p><b>SUPERSTITION</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thailand’s main religion is Buddhism, which entails many superstitious beliefs. To increase their good luck and ward off evil spirits and bad luck in the ring, fighters often wear tattoos and amulets or undergo wards and ceremonies. An example of this is the <i>Mongkon</i> (mōŋkʰōn; มงคล), a piece of headgear worn during <i>Wai Khru Ram Muay</i>. It is given to a fighter by his teacher after he has gained sufficient knowledge and ability, and is believed to hold special powers. They also wear fragments of their ancestors’ bones in the <i>Mongkon</i> or in armbands around the bicep, believing that this way, the spirits of their ancestors would help them in their fights. <i>Sak Yant</i> are special Thai tattoos done by monks and witch doctors using bamboo needles. Different shapes and symbols each have a special meaning, meant to bring good fortune. Amulets called <i>Kreung Rang</i> are also worn for pre-fight rituals.

      <h3>MODERN MUAY THAI</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Nowadays, Muay Thai is viewed as an international sport or as a form of entertainment. This view is believed to have first started in the 15th century, when the techniques of Muay Thai was taken from the battlefield and put into training centres. Soon, Muay Thai became a competition to prove one’s worth and skill. The Thai enjoyed attending these fights as spectators, and its popularity spread across the country. However, these fights were often unregulated and dangerous, ending only when one fighter could no longer get up.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Muay Thai gained international recognition by the 1900s. During World War II, Thai soldiers that were posted overseas practiced Muay Thai amongst themselves. Their European and American comrades always enjoyed watching their training sessions, with the French labelling Muay Thai as <i>“Le Sport Orient”</i>. The foreign soldiers wished to learn the techniques and traditions of Muay Thai, and brought this knowledge back to their home countries. In terms of competition, Muay Thai was westernised with proper rules similar to boxing, a division into weight classes, time limits and the use of a boxing ring and protective gear, turning it into a much safer sport.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Recently, Muay Thai was established as an official Olympic sport. Many professional fighters and committees acknowledge its effectiveness, and various international councils have been set up to regulate it as a safe ring sport like the World Muaythai Council (WMC) and the International Federation of Muaythai Amateur (IFMA).
